### Interesting projects

https://github.com/hackedteam - An "open source" spyware application designed for Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, Blackberry, etc.

https://github.com/adblockplus/adblockpluschrome - Since we're planning to make a Chrome extension, this is my favorite extension that's open to the public.  Obviously, this is a much larger scale project than what we hope to accomplish in the next several weeks.  However, it serves as a great basis for beginners to write Chrome extensions.
